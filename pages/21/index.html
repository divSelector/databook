  <p class="message-text">I love how much soul your website has! Also on existentialism: in my experience it&#x27;s actually very empowering since it focuses on compassion and finding/creating your own meaning in life. But I can certainly understand why people might find some of its literature daunting.</p>

  <p class="message-text">Hi. The layout of your site is great and the content has soul like a personal website should.

I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s possible to add a Twitter account to an RSS reader. That way you could get updates from Twitter accounts you care about without relying on the bloated app.

I too got hooked on graphic design from the moment I pirated Photoshop when I was 15. These days I use Krita and Inkscape, but it&#x27;s still as fun as ever.

I don&#x27;t know much about Tekken, but I do play a lot of Street Fighter III. If you&#x27;re into old arcade stuff, check out my website. My Versus City was running the arcade version of Tekken 5 at some point in it&#x27;s life.

Have a nice day.</p>

  <p class="message-text">Hey I keep coming back and rereading some stuff in your about me &quot; I learned that it was possible to transform reality by turning knowledge and ideas into practice. The idea is that reading and learning aren’t enough on their own; only through personal participation can you truly comprehend things. Through this process, you can develop an intimate understanding of the world and your role in it... It was a necessary death which allowed me to transition from being a passenger to being an autonomous human being. I learned how to participate in the practical struggle to change reality.&quot; 

I would really appreciate more insight on these points.</p>

  <p class="message-text">LIKE i never really bothered to blend the colors very well! i notice now the outlines tend to be stark in contrast to the color theyre outlining with my skins but they look so much nicer to me when theyre softer!!!! plus id usually jusdt choose a random color that didnt mix well with the others i was using. so less spontaneous palette now</p>

  <p class="message-text">nunyabusiness You snail-skulled little rabbit. Would that a hawk pick you up, drive its beak into your brain, and upon finding it rancid set you loose to fly briefly before spattering the ocean rocks with the frothy pink shame of your ignoble blood. May you choke on the queasy, convulsing nausea of your own trite, foolish beliefs. You are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You are grimy, squalid, nasty and profane. You are foul and disgusting. You&#x27;re a fool, an ignoramus. I actually love this copypasta with my entire heart</p>

  <p class="message-text">I really don&#x27;t get the use of venting to strangers online, like what are they going to really do, y&#x27;know? I mean yeah they can give you advice, but I feel like talking to people who you truly engage with in real life is the best option.</p>

  <p class="message-text">1. Not everyone has a safe space irl to vent, nor can everyone afford mental health treatment.
2. Some people would rather get things off their chest without risking stressing out their friends and loved ones in the process.

Having a friend or family member who is struggling mentally can be just as stressful as being the person mentally struggling, if they have basic human empathy that is, because not everyone does.

The reason I have the question about replying to entries here is so that I know who does and doesn&#x27;t need advice, reassurance, etc. Because as I said, some people just need to vent, and don&#x27;t necessarily want a response. Emotions are better let out than bottled up, and if I can provide a space for people to let out that negative emotion without the pressure of a relationship attached, then I am more than happy to do that.</p>

  <p class="message-text">Being as big of a [censored] up as I am is so embarrassing. And I know it&#x27;s not only embarrassing for me, but for everyone who associates with me. I&#x27;m a grown man constantly crying like a child, because I&#x27;m not mentally of emotionally equipped to deal with he stress I&#x27;m put under on a daily basis. 

Being physically almost 19 and feeling mentally 15 is literally the most traumatic shit I&#x27;ve ever been through that didn&#x27;t come at the hands of another person. I feel horrible and childish all the time no matter how hard I try to act mature or even just normal for my age. I don&#x27;t get along with literally anyone and I feel like everyone is scared of me for one reason or another. And why does literally everyone know more about me than they should? Like I&#x27;ve never met you, why do you know about shit that happened 2 years ago in my life?

Not to mention how I literally CANNOT escape my past. Like I get it, I hurt a lot of people, but that was years ago, and I&#x27;ve apologized extensively, cut contact, been to therapy, etc. So why am I still getting sent death threats? Getting called a pedo and a groomer, which was never true to begin with because 1. I was a minor, and 2. I was never intentionally talking sexually to anyone more than 2 years younger than me.

The few people who saw through the rumors and gave me a chance are either gone now or rarely speak to me. I [censored] up literally everything. Relationships, job opportunities, my social standing, everything. I hate myself, and I hate who I am as a person. I hate the way that I talk, the way that I act, the way that I think, breathe, and feel. I hate every aspect of my own being and I genuinely hope that I kill myself or someone else kills me one of these days because I know, no matter how hard I try not to, I&#x27;m only going to hurt more people. It will never stop. Because for some reason my default is just to abuse others; and I don&#x27;t know why, because I really, truly don&#x27;t want or mean to.

But still somehow beneath all of that I just want someone to love me. To truly love me. OR, better yet, to be obsessed with me in the way that I obsess over other people. For once. I want to feel like I matter to someone.</p>

  <p class="message-text">I honestly think that the military has ruined my life.

I enlisted about a week after I graduated high school. That was over a year ago. I wanted to be able to go to college without having any debts to pay, and I wanted to do something great with my life. I wanted to enlist in the Air Force since middle school, and it was my dream to be a Military Policeman. Back then it seemed so cool, but now that I&#x27;m here it&#x27;s nothing but mundane.

I&#x27;ve received injuries during training that require physical therapy. I can&#x27;t run or walk while wearing anything on my back without thinking my calves, or spine will snap.

A few months ago, my mom and I fell behind on rent. It was the slow season for her job, and I was only making minimum wage aside from my monthly drill paychecks. With so many other bills to pay, and my two cats that I take care of we lacked the money to pull together that month&#x27;s rent. We were facing eviction, so I decided to take action, and call one of my Sergeants to see if I could get a loan to pay the rent. The bank on base would need to see that I have enough income coming in to pay the loan back, so I would have to go work on base for a few weeks.

The thing is, it&#x27;s been over two months. I was never able to get the loan because I don&#x27;t have credit. With each day that passes more fees get applied on top of the rent. We&#x27;re getting closer and closer to three months of unpaid rent. My command wants me to work on base full time and has done nothing but make my life a living hell. They have tried to turn me against my mother saying that she&#x27;s stealing my money when I know she&#x27;s not. I have to give my mom the money to pay bills since only one bill was connected to my bank account, and everything else came out of hers. They kept feeding me all these negative things like &quot;your mother is just using you for your money&quot; and &quot;she just wants you to come home so she can manipulate you&quot;.

My mom had a stroke not long before I graduated high school, and ever since then our lives have had to change. My mom can only work from home, and I take care of her from time to time. Because of her decline in health, less money was coming in, and I needed to step up. It&#x27;s always been us against the world ever since my dad left when I was just 5 years old. He never paid child support.

I have no one except her, and she only has me. It still hurts that I almost ruined our relationship because I was allowing my command to put all these things into my head. I didn&#x27;t have the confidence to say anything because they heavily out rank me. At least my commander is understanding. He&#x27;s a very nice man, and it seems like he&#x27;s really the only one I&#x27;m comfortable talking to.

I never wanted this. I don&#x27;t want to live 3 hours away from my mom, grandma, and friends. I don&#x27;t want to think about anything related to this, my base housing paperwork, signing orders, arming up, going to work. None of it.

I go to work, I&#x27;m alone for my entire shift from 6pm - 6am.
I go back to my hotel room, I&#x27;m alone there too.

I miss my cats, my mom, my bedroom, the friends that I had just made at college. It hurts that if I had never called to ask for help, I wouldn&#x27;t have had to drop out of college again and would&#x27;ve gotten my grant money. That would&#x27;ve been enough. Now I&#x27;m stuck here living in a hotel room, working 12 hours with barely any time off, or time to myself. When I do get time, it&#x27;s like I don&#x27;t know what to do with myself. Nothing is fun anymore. I want to play my new Pokemon game, but I&#x27;m too tired to pick up my Switch.

I thought I could find some sort of escape in my regiment, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to help either. I don&#x27;t get any tags on recruitments, the community drives me nuts, and not a single soul seems to be connected to reality. 

I want to go home, and pretend like none of this ever happened, but there&#x27;s no going back now. I&#x27;ve made my choices, and I need to live with it. I don&#x27;t want to have all this responsibility this early on in my life. I turn 20 soon, and it looks like I won&#x27;t be able to take off to even celebrate my birthday. I&#x27;m tired of being sad, and not being able to find anything worth being joyous about. I miss being happy to boot up my Playstation that my mom helped me pick out once I returned from training. It was supposed to be our Playstation for us to enjoy, but now it sits on a hotel desk with all my games at home.

I brought so many things for me to do, but I can&#x27;t seem to pick any of them up. I just wish the money that I need could come falling out of the sky, but I know that&#x27;s not how the world works.

I wish it did.</p>

  <p class="message-text">I understand completely that feeling of financial helplessness, as well as the exhaustion that makes you too tired to do the things you love. I&#x27;m very sorry about your mother&#x27;s medical incident, and I&#x27;m also sorry that your father left your family; mine left around the same time so I relate to that as well.

I&#x27;m not entirely sure what I can do or say to help you feel better, but I do believe that you are a strong individual, and that you can and will find a way to make things work for not only yourself but your mother as well.

I don&#x27;t know how the military works, as I&#x27;ve been anti-military, especially anti-american-military for a very long time, and haven&#x27;t really looked into it much because it never interested me, but if you can, and you think it would do more good than bad, I would suggest finding a legal and safe way out, for your own mental health. College is gonna be a bitch to pay for, but once you have a degree, you can get a better job to help pay everything off.

If there&#x27;s one thing I can recommend for right now, it would be finding a way to build your credit score, as that&#x27;s someone I know I need to do right now as well in order to unlock more things in my life that will help me further down the road.

If you need someone to yap at/to or be friends with, and if you have discord, you&#x27;re welcome to reach out to me directly. I&#x27;m shy but I always reply eventually, and don&#x27;t mind long stretches of silence from people.

Things will get better eventually, if you allow them to, and if you find a way to help them get better that will speed up the process. As corny as that sounds, it&#x27;s true. But as always, it all starts with you.

Wishing you well on your current and future endeavors.</p>

  <p class="message-text">hi i only came here cause i like signing atabooks. meatball. here are some lyrics! [Verse 1]
Bullies stand up, losers sit down
Everybody know I&#x27;m a king, without a crown
And the cut on your heart, mark on your face
Never should&#x27;ve came here in the fucking first place
I hate you and you hate me, such a hateful family
And I could tell some lies to you at the dinner I had to suffer through
Like I am gonna try again, to stop these drugs and change my friends
To try to make all the amends for all the shit I never said
You realized you gotta change, you acted bad, you misbehaved
You got your way, so have your way, got your way, so have your way

[Verse 2]
The farther I can reach, I&#x27;m such a fucking outlaw
There&#x27;s blood inside the leech, for every sin and God fall
The fucking garden eats all of the fucking good ones
And I could never sleep because the night is so fun
I hate you and you hate me, such a hateful family
And I could tell some lies to you at the dinner I had to suffer through
Like go on, get &#x27;em, sister, go, I can&#x27;t do this shit alone
I came from a broken home, so look at all my broken bones
Count me in but count me out, I know what this is about
I&#x27;m the next, I&#x27;ll get in line, just let me have my fucking time

[Outro]
The farther I can reach, I&#x27;m such a fucking outlaw
There&#x27;s blood inside the leech, for every sin and God fall
The fucking garden eats all of the fucking good ones
And I could never sleep because the night is so fun
I hate you and you hate me, such a hateful family
And I could tell some lies to you at the dinner I had to suffer through</p>

  <p class="message-text">I miss him. I wish I didn&#x27;t, but I do. I was happy that he was gone at first because it was like this weight was lifted off my shoulders, but then I realized that he was one of the few good things I had left in my life, and when he left, he took two other things with him. Now I just feel hollow. I promised I wouldn&#x27;t stalk him this time. But I occasionally just check on him. Check his atabook, or patreon, or use an alt acc to see if he&#x27;s on ponytown and if he&#x27;s doing okay.

I don&#x27;t want to speak to him. I don&#x27;t want contact. I don&#x27;t deserve that and he doesn&#x27;t need that in his life. It would only hurt us both more. I would genuinely just be happy knowing he&#x27;s happy. Knowing that he&#x27;s okay and especially if I could just know he was doing better without me.

It&#x27;s selfish, but more than anything I just want to know whether or not I was really the thing dragging him down, or if that was just a self-hate delusion. I don&#x27;t care if it end up hurting me, I just want to know. I need to know. I pray that he&#x27;s better. I pray that he&#x27;s with better people, doing better things.

If he ever sees this, and knows its about him, I hope he gives me a single sign. Just something to let me know he&#x27;s doing okay. Because I&#x27;m terrified that I&#x27;ve permanently traumatized yet another person I loved.</p>

  <p class="message-text">Okk so uh, I&#x27;ve had issues with my mental health in the past. I worked hard to fix myself so I can be a better person/friend to individuals around me.

In the past, I would just randomly feel all gloomy and just be a negative asshole to my (ex) friends- which I deeply regret and hope they&#x27;re doin&#x27; alright now. I don&#x27;t even know what caused my mood to swing so fast back then, I always told myself I&#x27;d work on it- if that makes sense- to my (ex) friends, but would turn around and just repeat the whole moody shit again.

I thought to myself abt jst cutting them off so I can try and actually focus on idk fixing myself? In the end, I did drop em. At the time, I thought maybe they were the reason why I was switching emotions in a snap of a finger. To be honest, they partially was, I felt left out at times, unwanted and shit- and yes I somewhat spoke up to them abt it but the same shit happened so.
I just felt annoyed at them all of a sudden, like just one day I didn&#x27;t enjoy their company as much as I used to, I didn&#x27;t feel like a member of the friend group yk. I probably shouldn&#x27;t have felt that way, I do have my regrets abt having such stupid thoughts.

When I cut off certain people, it felt as if a weight was lifted. I didn&#x27;t feel as if I was suffocating or wtv around them, that I didn&#x27;t have to put on an act jst so they wouldn&#x27;t think I felt some type of way abt them or even feel that I was slightly annoyed yk. I had a chance to fix myself and I took it. Yes, I do miss some of them dearly, but I&#x27;m happy that I chose to focus on my mental health than ruin it by being around people who&#x27;s company I didn&#x27;t even enjoy. (I prolly sound like an asshole im sorry)

But that&#x27;s not really the main thing I&#x27;m venting about, I&#x27;ve been trying to do my best to not go back to my old ways, getting annoyed at ppl for no reason or just simply cutting them off. I don&#x27;t want all my progress to go to waste over some silly ass thought.

I&#x27;ve been doing my best to prevent anything that could possibly make me return to my old habits again. I&#x27;m trying my best to engage with others and not seem dry but I&#x27;m failing at it. I don&#x27;t want to lose these friends I have right now, I&#x27;m scared that I&#x27;ll be alone again. I don&#x27;t want to restart everything I worked hard for, I don&#x27;t know what to do.</p>

  <p class="message-text">I&#x27;ve been in your exact situation many times before, and even currently, and I can tell you right now that you&#x27;re not doing anything wrong by prioritizing your mental health over relationships that you&#x27;re not invested in or that are hurting you in some way.

I understand the fear of regressing in recovery, as I&#x27;ve done it many times, and am even currently experiencing a severe relapse in my recovery. Still, I can tell you now that so long as you remain aware of yourself, your behavior, habits, voluntary and involuntary reactions, and have good communication with those you hold closest to you, you&#x27;ll be just fine.

Having a support system to help keep you on track is very good and can be extremely helpful when needed! Of course, being able to read your own emotions is just as important, and if you can manage that, you&#x27;ll be just fine.

From where I&#x27;m sitting, you seem to be doing just fine. Don&#x27;t overthink it; you&#x27;ll be alright.</p>

  <p class="message-text">Everything feels so dull lately.

Nothing appeals to me anymore, not even my hobbies. My piano has been collecting dust in the corner of my room for the past 3 years, I haven’t picked up a pen in a good while now. 

I get no sense of accomplishment from anything, and in the rare instances that I do it fizzles out so quickly that it wouldn’t matter anyway. I don’t feel like I’m living for myself anymore, I don’t think I ever have. Everything I’ve ever done, every major decision I’ve made for my life was to cater to somebody else; what they wanted me to be. I exist for other people and I don’t remember when I last had a genuine dream of my own, of how I want to live, of what job I want to do. 

I don’t have anybody irl I can trust, or even laugh with for fuck’s sake. And I want somebody to love, somebody to love me. To make the world feel less like it’s closing in on me but that’s exactly the problem, because I crave love but I can’t handle it. I’m so unused to basic affection that it genuinely makes me uncomfortable and I try to pull away the moment I get too overwhelmed with it. One of the only things that keeps me going is the need for connection but I don’t know how to be loved. I don’t know how to love. 

I hate this country and I hate everyone in it and I hate myself and I hate my parents for having me just to shape me into their ideal version of a golden child. I’m nothing but bragging rights to them. I just wish somebody would kill me already. 

Time passes in a blur and I never feel like I’m ever really present in the world, I don’t hear my name and think “that’s me”. I look in the mirror and I don’t see myself. I’m unremarkable, I’m painfully average at everything and I blend in with crowds. I’m downright pathetic and nobody I talk to remembers my name, everybody forgets after a while. 

I don’t want to be here anymore. I’m afraid. I can’t see myself making it past my 20s and honestly, I don’t think I want to.</p>

  <p class="message-text">I understand how you feel. That lack of interest in anything can be very intense and even painful at times. I think in times where nothing you know seems appealing, trying out something new might help; sparking new interests rather than forcing yourself to stick to the old ones.

I&#x27;m not sure what advice to give as far as the love situation goes. I myself struggle deeply with the subject as I tend to love very aggressively, possessively, and obsessively, and have driven away nearly everyone in my life because of it. The best I can really say is find someone you can relate to, who understands you and appreciates you for who you are as a person, without care for who you&#x27;ve been in the past, or who you are for them. Living and breathing for others breeds a lot of negativity and leads people to see you as an accessory to their own life, rather than a meaningful and long-term facet of it.

If you hate who you are now, create a new you, a new sense of self, and start over the best you can. I&#x27;ve had to do it more than once, and it&#x27;s not easy, but the payoff is worth it just to get to be who you want to be. Especially if you&#x27;re an adult. I don&#x27;t know what the culture is like over on that side of the world, but you should still do your best for yourself instead of for others. Once you achieve self recognition and understanding, life gets a lot better; speaking from experience.

If you need a friend, you can contact me (if you have discord). I&#x27;m active most of the day and always open to just chat, or whatever you need.

Have a good day, and stay safe.</p>

  <p class="message-text">im terrified, and tired.
i am terrified of so many things, that its going to seriously kill me one day. my heart rate is unnatural according to the doctors, my parents seriously dont care, and so much more is making me stressed. im terrified that im going to die one day and the only thing my friends will know as the last thing i message them is im  feeling sick or something. ive been on t he verge of dying, verge of having a heart attack so many times and it makes me sick
my parents yelled at me for having a disgusting room while i was the sickest i ever felt, and now i just feel like nothing again. my fp&#x27;s been grounded off one of our only communication playform and they moved off to ohio so now my stressed that i cant talk to them for weeks again. i just hate this i hate how everything once again feels like its collapsing. just a few weeks ago i was at my best point, now im at my worst again.
i hate my parents for never taking me serious, i hate how i am stuck never being able to be happy. i struggle with drawing because it never looks right. i hate every craft i do anymore. it feels basic.
i want to kms, but im scared that my fp wont find out until days, weeks after. they stayed up scared for me once and that just tugs at my chest, i dont want to live but i hate wanting to die, out of fear one of the only people that actually listen to me and enjoy talking with me
they&#x27;re so concerned for me it confuses me why . i feel like im worth nothing so whyy do people care and genuinely ask if im okay</p>

  <p class="message-text">I don&#x27;t know what to say beyond that your parents aren&#x27;t helping your situation and killing yourself really isn&#x27;t worth it. You&#x27;re loved and cared for even if it doesn&#x27;t feel like it most days, that&#x27;s why people check on you, because they care and love you.

If your parents won&#x27;t help you, reach out to someone else who can, especially if it&#x27;s for medical reasons. Call child protective services if you really need to. Anything to keep yourself healthier and out of dire situations where you&#x27;re worried you&#x27;re going to die.

Giving you all my good luck and wishing you well on your recovery.</p>

  <p class="message-text">She cares for you. Even if you don&#x27;t appreciate what she&#x27;s doing, which, you don&#x27;t have to, at least pretending to for her sake might be good for both of you. I&#x27;ve been doing that much for my own grandmother for a handful of years now and I am an adult.

It&#x27;s best to live now letting her love you the way she thinks you need, than to be bitter and regret it later, because she won&#x27;t be here forever, and you never know when she could go.</p>

  <p class="message-text">I&#x27;ve always been someone who doesn&#x27;t like when friends leave me. I can leave people I just met, but one it&#x27;s a friend, my whole world just breaks. My ex-online brother said he didn&#x27;t wanna be my friend anymore earlier this year (around august) and I&#x27;m still not over it. We were online siblings. How could he? I must say it was partially my fault since I did invite a new person to our group server without him wanting another member, but still.

I can&#x27;t even look at the fandoms he liked anymore. I tried to get into them before we broke off, but he didn&#x27;t really care THAT much.

Bungou Stray Dogs. That was the last fandom I remember him being in. I desperately tried to get into it, despite it not being something I liked. He had friends at his school that liked it. He preferred those friends over me. He valued them over me. I asked if we could play, and he said no because he was tired... He was on playing with his friends. Why he didn&#x27;t care for me in the end? Because I talked about a fandom I like. Splatoon. He could&#x27;ve just muted the damn server while he was at school, it&#x27;s not a big fucking deal. I guess he doesn&#x27;t know what silent notifications mean.

I spent all my free time talking to him and my other siblings. Maybe I was overbearing. His parting message mentioned him &quot;bending over backwards&quot; or something, I think. If anything, he was exaggerating it for dramatic effect.

History repeats itself, y&#x27;know. My real life brother has made friends with some pretty cool people on ponytown. He likes Pokemon. They like it too, but I&#x27;m not really a fan. He spent a lot of time with them and I quickly grew jealous. I didn&#x27;t want a repeat. I wanted my brother. I got lucky this time, he got reminded of a childhood anime we used to watch, Naruto. I get to share an interest with him again. No more fear of losing him. For now, of course.

My first friends upon coming to France didn&#x27;t like me. They found me weird. They avoided me. How cruel, we were only 6. And at first chance, told me to make friends with a girl in the grade below me, at which point they never talked to me again. That girl I met was my best friend for years. We loved the same things, played the same games, went to each other&#x27;s birthdays, everything. 

She had to move back to the USA. I haven&#x27;t talked to her in years. My messages don&#x27;t go through.

I just wish something could stay the same for over two years again. Even if it ends after three.</p>

  <p class="message-text">I find that forcing yourself to enjoy things just because someone else does is a hollow way to live. You should enjoy the things you enjoy and bond with those who enjoy them too, and learn to find common ground with people who don&#x27;t share interests with you in other ways. You don&#x27;t have to have everything in common with a person to be close with them, and learning to accept and cope with the fact that not everyone is going to be around forever will do you more good than trying to force relationships. In the words of someone who I don&#x27;t remember the name of because it was 2am on YouTube shorts, &quot;relationships are like farts; if you have to force it, it&#x27;s probably gonna be shit.&quot;

Hopefully my comedy is well placed.</p>

  <p class="message-text">. im so hoping that this will never be seen by them.

. I nearly had a break down today sincei was remembering a friend that i met through regiments . we havent talked much in the regiment but ended up bonding in their scouts that they owned. Main point , my latest times i had interacted with them i kept having an odd feeling , it was like something was pressuring on my chest . at first i ignored it but it went to the point that it was so overwhelming that i decided to move accounts . i tried moving WITH regiments i was in but one of mutual friends we had found out as they were a staff in there and with that they immediately said that i moved accounts in a server where the perspn was . ps. i did NOT want anyone to move to that account as all i wanted was to figure out WHAT caused the feeling and to get a BREAK from it . which obviously failed cause of the reason above . and so with that , i tried sucking it up again . but it did NOT get better so i just kept getting overwhelmed by it over and over again , constantly questioning why its happening as it did not happen for a year ive known them . I gave up and moved once more without telling ANYONE but my online mother as the only person i trusted telling . Eventually i tried distracting myself with regiments and of course they were in 1 of the ones i joined . they found out its me n stuff , which lead to me having a dm in the morning .

. i understand why they were upset , even though my friends keep telling me its not my fault it feels like it is , honestly. I got told that i did a good thing to take a break off contact but it still feels wrong . I tried explaining myself to them but i feel like they wont respond as i didnt respond to their message . i was way too scared to . i get easily overwhelmed by confrontations : ( . i need honest opinion here , is what i did wrong ?

. sorry if this is too messy to read ... i usually dont vent publicly .</p>

  <p class="message-text">No, I dont think you did anything wrong. If there is one thing I could say you should have done differently, I would say you should have communicated with them about it, as communication truly is key; but I do understand the fear of confrontation.

If you needed a break then taking one was the right move. If you needed to get out of that relationship then doing so was the right move. But next time, if you can, I would suggest giving warning, or setting a boundary about contact. You d9nt need to wait for their reply, or even read it if you don&#x27;t want to. You&#x27;re allowed to put your foot down on things, because your boundaries are to be respected, especially when they&#x27;re perfectly reasonable.

I hope this situation gets better for you, and it was perfectly fine to read, dont worry.</p>

  <p class="message-text">Sometimes I wonder to myself how different life would be if I weren’t born in the country I’m from, coming from a religious family I feel like I’m inclined to follow the beliefs yet I always find myself never coming or agreeing to the terms of the religion. I’ve been caught on numerous occasions doing things that are considered sinful and yet I never felt an ounce of regret for it. I’m constantly getting beliefs shoved down my throat and it’s become hard to even live peacefully without constantly thinking about how little regret I had and wondering if I maybe should be the saint my parents would have wanted me to be. The consequences are eating me alive and I seriously gave up trying to find solace in the religious aspect of my life. Everywhere I go in my hometown I’m constantly reminded by the religious trauma I’ve had endured in my life. I feel like im just another girl abandoned by god ever since I was young. It reminds me of a quote I read from Sylvia plath; I talk to god but the sky is empty.

Thank you for creating this guestbook, I’m not sure I would have ever said this to anyone, even the people I call close to me.  I understand if you don’t reply, this topic is honestly labeled taboo for some people (ᴗ_ ᴗ。)</p>

  <p class="message-text">I am a Satanist who was raised Christian by my grandmother, so I can understand that feeling of betraying your religion and your family simply by disagreeing with their views. However, I&#x27;ve found that once you can accept that living for yourself and looking out for yourself is more important than anything else, you&#x27;ll find some inner peace, even if there&#x27;s hostility in the world around you regarding topics you&#x27;re not comfortable with. I don&#x27;t know where you&#x27;re from, but at least here in America, religion is not the end all be all of existence; and regardless of what you believe, once you leave this world, the body everyone associates you with will be six feet underground and forgotten in time. Whether or not that&#x27;s comforting to you, it&#x27;s the truth.

I&#x27;m glad you feel comfortable using this resource. It&#x27;s made me happy seeing people use it, and I intend to continue running it for as long as this platform stands, so feel free to use it whenever you need.</p>

  <p class="message-text">There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward it I have now surpassed. My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better world for anyone. In fact, I want my pain to be inflicted on others. I want no one to escape, but even after admitting this, there is no catharsis. My punishment continues to elude me and I gain no deeper knowledge of myself. No new knowledge can be extracted from my telling. This confession has meant nothing.</p>

  <p class="message-text">I&#x27;ve been there many times. I can tell you that hurting others or even wishing pain upon others will not make you feel better, and in some cases can actually make you feel much worse. But in the words of Mitski, if you need to be mean, be mean to me. I&#x27;ve made it my singular goal at this point in time to help people in any way I can, and if you just need someone to let that emotion out onto I can be that person, as I truly don&#x27;t mind. Otherwise, anything else you need, let me know ow and I&#x27;ll try to help the best I can. /nf</p>

  <p class="message-text">i feel alone. i have friends sure. but sometimes i cant stand them. they never did anything to make me mad or feel unloved, but sometimes i just cant. sometimes everything feels fake like someone is trying to manipulate me. it sucks i cant trust nobody. i hate having to stop responding. sometimes my brain makes me think they&#x27;ll say horrible shit to me and it sucks too. i should trust them but i never know how things work</p>

  <p class="message-text">I understand how that feels. If you need a break from social interaction from time to time then go ahead and take those breaks, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that. From the sounds of it you have a pretty bad case of social anxiety that&#x27;s making you overthink about things you know aren&#x27;t actually a problem.

I would recommend seeking a therapist to help you work through that to avoid.it becoming a worse issue in the future.

You&#x27;re doing just fine, don&#x27;t let those intrusive thoughts convince you otherwise.</p>

  <p class="message-text">I feel like I&#x27;m being manipulated by my ex girlfriend and I&#x27;m just letting her do it. She keeps blocking me and unblocking me, saying she&#x27;ll make up for it, and I believe her every single time. But then she blocks me again with no warning and I&#x27;ll feel like it was all my fault. All of my friends keep telling me to leave her, that she&#x27;s not worth my time and effort, but the thing is I can&#x27;t. I can&#x27;t just throw away our 3 years of good friendship over what I know is just an episode. I really don&#x27;t want to listen to them, despite them practically pleading with me to do it.</p>

  <p class="message-text">Unfortunately leaving her at this point would be the best thing for both of you. If you allow her to continue doing this, grabbing your attention, pulling you in, and then leaving without warning, you&#x27;re only going to get hurt, and she likely wont ever see what she&#x27;s doing as wrong, especially if it has to do with mental health issues, regardless of how much she&#x27;s hurting you.

Now, that&#x27;s not always the case, but it is a very common case. Showing people that their actions have consequences is always one of the best way to elicit change both quickly and efficiently, without long lectures and wasted emotional and physical energy. Even if you eventually reopen contact with her, forcing her to be without you might be the push she needs to see just how much she needs you. And in the end, if none of that works, cutting ties might be necessary; but there is always something to try before it gets to that point, so don&#x27;t be scared to speak up and put your foot down. Your feelings and boundaries matter, too.</p>

Funnily enough I don&#x27;t get stuff off of my chest that often. If I do, I feel disgusted by it because of my inner thoughts telling me that what I said back there was, for the lack of better words, cringe. And I should just &quot;grow up&quot; and keep it to myself next time.

  <p class="message-text">Sometimes I wonder if I caused my ex to leave me. I wasn&#x27;t ever harmful towards him, but. I did have anger issues (still to this day, but I can manage better). I wonder if maybe me being bipolar ever caused him to be driven away? I never once harmed him, he even confessed so, but I still can&#x27;t wonder if maybe me even existing was too much for him to handle. Why would you tell someone you loved them, why would you show them things you wanted for our future. Why would you always be there for me at every moment I needed your help and never leave me stranded, yet the moment your friend asks you to sleep with them, you do it with no hesitation or remorse. Why would you cheat on someone? I don&#x27;t ever want to bash anyone called Oliver, but everytime I hear that name I panic because oh my god I don&#x27;t ever want him in my life. I&#x27;m so scared he&#x27;ll try to reach out to me</p>

  <p class="message-text">Your ex was very much in the wrong by cheating on you, and honestly sometimes people don&#x27;t need a reason to do it, they just do it. It&#x27;s shitty, and very disgusting of them, and I&#x27;m sorry that you had to go through that. I doubt anything you did or didn&#x27;t do caused him to do what he did. It&#x27;s not your fault that he cheated, so don&#x27;t blame yourself.

You&#x27;re still worthy of love and positivr attention, regardless of what&#x27;s happened to you.</p>

  <p class="message-text">Okay, first off Hello uhh i really dont know how to open up to someone or websites stuff but i really want to get this off my chest or head but yah. So, my life has been kinda average like normal grades, loving family stuff etc etc, Im already in my final year of high school and it had been really made me more anxious and idk, feeling nervous. Heck like your going to get a job soon or get into legal age. I do want to grow up but the feeling is just complicated. 

Other than that, this is a different topic about school now i really want to know how to cope with time management or get motivation, time to time i really did not take my study seriously and now im probably having a hard time finishing my homeworks or understanding the lessons so yeheey for me???

Thats all i have to say rn, probably will vent more(?) I hope you dont mind me coming back here time to time.</p>

  <p class="message-text">Yes rainstorms count, and no I don&#x27;t mind if you come back, use this as much as you need and I will reply whenever I get the chance if you want/need me to, so hello! Welcome to my office. /humor

I understand the feeling of anxiety that comes along with becoming an adult, because I had to go through it only 10 months ago. It&#x27;s scary and confusing, and you&#x27;re going to gain a lot of new responsibilities and people are going to suddenly expect way more from you. I don&#x27;t tell you this to scare you, but to warn you, because no one warned me, and it hit like a train when I suddenly had to assess and cope with the new information being shoved down my throat.

You seem fairly lucky in the grades and family aspect, which will help you moving forward, but of course there&#x27;s more to life than good grades and a loving family.

As far as studying and motivation goes, finding motivation is a different process for everyone, it can be easy, or it can be hard. I personally find that giving myself a reward system helped a lot in my senior year with motivating myself, but also using my creative energy to do assignments in a way that was more interesting and fun for me, while still getting the assignment done properly of course.

Time management is an important skill to learn, but also doing things in a way that is best for you. As a psychology nerd I feel the need to hand over a bit of information in the form of: studies prove that students who study for 30 minutes at a time over multiple sessions retain information better than those who cram in hour or longer study sessions. Paraphrased and in my own words, of course, but I hope that helps!
Beyond that, taking notes in a way that makes sense to you, even if they make no sense to anyone else, can be helpful! I did that a lot, and it held more information for me while being way less intense due to not being as dense as traditional note-taking.

Beyond that, seeing school as a stepping stone of life and not a road block is helpful, and changing your perspective about something can really change the way you engage with it in a meaningful way!

I hope any if not all of this is helpful to you in some capacity! I promise you&#x27;ll get through this transition just fine. /gen</p>

THANK YOU SO MUCH THOUGH I&#x27;m happy you like my art and my site heheh... I wanna be citrusy.
I WAS GONNA COMMENT ON YOUR GUESTBOOK FIRST, but you beat me to it!!! I&#x27;ll still send my comment soon anyways (might take a bit I&#x27;m slow...) but for now I just wanna say I love your fuwa collection!! I&#x27;ve always wanted fuwas of my favorite snow Mikus, 2013 n&#x27; 2015... (I&#x27;d also like to sew custom fuwas of my OCs one day, but I&#x27;d need to actually own one first since it&#x27;s hard for me to visualize the pattern from just images alone. It is necessary to own many a Miku for research purposes, yuppp.)
Anyhow, it&#x27;s nice to meet youuu! I look forward to seein&#x27; you around!!!</p>

  <p class="message-text">Everyday I lose my mind when I remember the fact that my mom tried to full-on hit me because she thought I was faking my S/A. I was S/A&#x27;ed by my cousin when I was at least 5 or 6, they were 10 or whatsoever. They are currently an adult now but every time I think back to it just scares me.

I don&#x27;t even know who to tell my problems to except in anonymous forums or websites that actually give me a sense of mind. Everything sucks for me at this point. I&#x27;ll never be able to know if I&#x27;m in the wrong for what my cousin did to me or if I actually deserved it at all. It&#x27;s a pain in the neck to remember and I wish I could just accept that I am a victim.</p>

  <p class="message-text">You were a child. And while they were also a child, at 10 you know what a no-no square is and to not touch people there. You&#x27;re not in the wrong. Your cousin did a horrible thing, and sadly, I and many others can relate to that kind of trauma. You&#x27;re never in the wrong if someone does something horrible to you against your will. It&#x27;s not your fault. It wasn&#x27;t then and isn&#x27;t now. Even if you never told anyone for years, that&#x27;s not your fault either. It&#x27;s scary to seek help for that kind of thing because, unfortunately, not everyone is going to be kind when acknowledging it.

You were, and are a victim of that event, and I hope that you can receive proper help to cope with the trauma of it in a healthy way, and that you won&#x27;t have to suffer with it forever like so many people do.</p>

  <p class="message-text">I&#x27;ve been trying to get better. I really have. But noone believes in me anymore. I might drop out of school and quit all my future plans to be a surgeon because I&#x27;ve lost motivation to even get up and shower. I haven&#x27;t been to school is basically a month and I&#x27;m failing miserably. I lost all of my friends because they think I&#x27;m a freak and I think at this point I might just go back to hurting myself again. Or starving myself. My old best friend would also make fun of my appearance like no matter what I did with my hair I looked like shit. I was always too bug or too small. I&#x27;m never hygienic enough. And I&#x27;m still not. currently, I haven&#x27;t showered since like maybe Monday because I tried to go to school Tuesday. I went home before my first class even started though. I&#x27;m surprised I&#x27;ve brushed my teeth regularly though. My hair at one point like a week ago got so matted that I had to cut it all off because I couldn&#x27;t get out of bed to brush it. I just don&#x27;t know what to do. I&#x27;m scared I might result in drugs again or selfharm or some or of eating disorder. I&#x27;m scared and just tired.</p>

  <p class="message-text">I think a good first step would be mustering up the energy to get out of bed every day, even if you don&#x27;t do anything, just being out of bed is something. Personally that just means from my bed to my desk.

If you can, do your schoolwork from home. It needs to get done some way or another, whether you like it or not. Find help tools online if you need to, and work at your own pace, but be productive!

If you&#x27;re up to it, try showering every other day, and wash your hair every other time you shower if you can.

Little steps over time to help build habit and get you back into the swing of things. I&#x27;ve been where you are in the past, and semi-recently (i have a nasty infection bc of it, dont be like me/humor/srs), so I&#x27;m merely recommending to you the things that helped me. Everyone is different so it may not work for you, but you wont know until you try.

Regardless, I believe in you! If you need more support feel free to reach out again, either here or on discord if you have it! Have a nice day &lt;3</p>

  <p class="message-text">eridan goes by no pronouns please respect that
( btw turns out eridan nvr groomed me it was js unintentional manipulation )

and its basically like a soulbond , think of it as yinyang
yin and yang are complete opposites but cant live without eachother
it&#x27;s basically us , i dont think youd ever get it but we relate to eachother so much as well as sharing similar trauma and syncing ( saying / thinking the exact same thing at the exact same time ) along with similar disorders . yeah its just like that and we both HAEV come to thr conclusion its a soulbond so ya ,i know eridan wont leave me this time and if its not &quot; healthy &quot; then im sorry but why am i not slitting my stomach and listening to mitski songs while thinking of how we used to be ???? if anything eridans been helping and improving my mental health and listened to my vents countless of times , ive been there for eridan as well . eridans a very changed person , i dont think ive laughed harder on call when i wqs calling eridan .  please just stop &quot; looking out for me &quot; i beg light hearted , its MY life and i want to enjoy it without any interruptions . dont take this the wrong way</p>

  <p class="message-text">alot of bad things have happened in my life since i was about 6-7 but this really scarred me ---

june 5th 2023 on discord i met this person who dmed me due to mutual servers, we quickly bonded because we both liked k-pop and we talked alot, as of now our dms have over a thousand messages, i tried my best to match their energy like i do to any new person i meet, eventually about 3 days later we ended up dating. which was stupid of me but at the time i craved affection/attention. before this, i lied about my age to them and told them i was 13 turning 14 when i was actually 12 turning 13 and they were 15 turning 16. since we made sexual jokes and stuff our relationship eventually got more sexual, they began asking for pictures of my body, specifically my thighs and i agreed, since i was ignorant. i viewed this as love because of the affection they gave me and how much they made me feel like they cared for me, then they asked me to send them moaning audios, which i did and deeply regret. i really dont know why i didnt understand why what they were doing was wrong.

a few months(?) later, school started again and they started to be online on discord/instagram a little less, still shooting me messages every now and then until eventually they just stopped. then they disabled their instagram account (my only way of reaching them because they were inactive on discord) but come january 14th 2024, i remember that they had another instagram account and unsurprisingly (i have very bad amnesia) i couldn&#x27;t remember the name until then, so i decided to message them on there, no response. i messaged them again on the 21st and they replied two days later, saying that they&#x27;ve seen my messages but they were just busy, then we started talking again although it would take them hours or even days to respond, they would even say that they loved me, during this, our relationship felt more intimate and romantic to me again, after months of not talking to them at all. i hadn&#x27;t paid attention to anyone else i just stayed loyal. february 2nd at about 12 am, i had a mental breakdown due to the lack of responses, i felt like our love was fading and it was basically killing me, i prayed that night for god to change me or remove any flaws, i apologized over and over again for anything i had done that could drive them away from me. february 14th, i sent him a long paragraph explaining my disorders and why i have slight issues, and i got no response so after a week i just deleted it out of our dms.

february 26th(?) is when they blocked me on instagram, which confused me because it was so sudden and he didn&#x27;t message me before then or anything. after that i had a few failed attempts at contacting them so i eventually just got over it, a while later i had told my close close friend a little bit of it and they told me that i had been groomed. and i never knew until they told me.</p>

  <p class="message-text">Sadly your friend is right, you had been groomed. There&#x27;s not much that I can say on the matter other than it&#x27;s not your fault, and I hope you&#x27;re doing alright now. Learning from these mistakes and knowing what to look out for in the future will be an unfortunate but powerful skill to have on hand regardless of your age as you go through the online world.

Stay safe.</p>

  <p class="message-text">It&#x27;s okay to see someone&#x27;s faults while still loving them. A big part of relationships, especially romantic ones, is learning to get comfortable calling the other person out for the things they do that are unsavory, or harmful to yourself or others, for the betterment of everyone involved.

I suggest bringing it up again and really putting your foot down about it, because your boundaries are to be respected, and he shouldn&#x27;t be so hard on you over minor instances.</p>

  <p class="message-text">i genuinely dont know what to do after my mums death. she died on october 8th so its still really fresh. they gave us her ashes yesterday. i dont know what to do without her, im nothing. i miss hearing her laugh and talking to the dogs and my dad. i dont feel safe without her. she was everything to me. i cant kms because my dogs and boyfriend will miss me, so i guess thats enough to keep me alive. i miss her so much. i dont know why she drank herself to death. i could have helped her and i would have been more than happy to be a shoulder to cry on. when she went to the hospital she was getting better for a bit and then things plummeted so she was put into a coma and after three days we decided to pull the plug on her. watching her heartbeat go from 70 to 50 to 0 and holding her until she got cold really fucked me up. we had matching friendship bracelets and when she was put into the ICU they cut it off and that really hurt me so much and i dont know why. i dont feel safe without her. i really really need a hug but shes gone and i dont want one from my dad or brother. i want a hug from HER, she made me feel safe and loved and wanted and now shes gone. i just want her back. why did this happen why did she do this to herself does she even know how much i love her</p>

  <p class="message-text">Addiction and mental illness are a painfully tragic and oftentimes fatal combination. I don&#x27;t know your mother nor you and how your lives were, but I doubt if she knew how much it would pain you that she would have made the same mistakes.

The only thing you really can do is go through the grieving process at your own pace, and try to find peace and solace in the world without her. You will be okay, regardless of what you believe now. It&#x27;s natural to feel distressed and lost when someone dear to you passes on; but you can&#x27;t let it rule your life.

I wish you the best, and I hope you find someone who can give you that hug you need. Stay safe.</p>

  <p class="message-text">about a vcouple of days to maybe a week or 2 agao i had gotten home and sat at my computer only to find that my boyfriend had cut/harmed himself

thankfully it wasnt anything terrible or drasitc, he&#x27;d essentially just scratched himself but it scared the shit out of me. and i have reason to be afraid knowing my brother once scared himself up like a tiger

i tried not to make the situation about me but i couldnt stop telling him how scared i was and i couldnt stop crying he really did scared me half to death that at somepoint i tried praying and im not even religious 

i feel terrible about it still because i wholeheartedly believe i was manipulatng him the entire time despite him telling me i wasnt but i dont know f i can believe him any because no matter what the fuck i touch i either hurt it or ruin it or break it and honestly killing myself looks so tempting so i can free him from the burden of being with me</p>

  <p class="message-text">Expressing your concern for someone, especially a loved one, regardless of how, is entirely valid, and it&#x27;s very hard to manipulate someone if you don&#x27;t mean to.

I don&#x27;t think you did anything wrong, but hurting yourself would be wrong of you, and make you a hypocrite, and likely terrify him just as bad. It&#x27;s truly not worth killing yourself over. If you&#x27;re truly worried that you&#x27;re manipulating him, taking a break from the relationship to see how you both feel after even just a few days can help determine that much, and show you that either you&#x27;re comfortable together, or that perhaps you simply weren&#x27;t meant to be.

Either way, regardless of what you decide to do, I hope things go well for the both of you, and that you can find the solace you need, and that this experience only brings you closer together. Love him and all of his scars, even if they scare you.</p>

  <p class="message-text">Try making new friends, reaching out more, taking the initiative, or even finding new hobbies that might make you more approachable!

Sometimes all you need is a new perspective on your own life to flip a switch that will draw more people toward you. Personally it was unlocking my confidence; but it&#x27;s different for everyone.

I hope you find someone who really likes spending time with you, soon!</p>

  <p class="message-text">( sorry for any grammar mistakes in advance lol )
So as of recently in this summer vacation was dropped  by 2 of my best online friends. we had been friends since 2021 and met on ponytown. our friendship in general was already going downhill since 2022 when our full friendgroup kind of died and it just ended up with the 3 of us and my little brother. one of them that ill just call lee for short had to go on 3 month long hiatuses 3 times a year because she went to a boarding school wich honestly drifted away our friendship alot i guess? she never really caught up on slang or any trends and i would poke at her for it wich i thought was harmless because she never really told me it was actually hurting her. apparantly it actually really bothered wich she only told me at the end of our friendship and i guess i just feel stupid now?? like, now that i look back on everything i did i just feel like a horrible person because it just looks so clear that they didnt want to hang around with me at all and that i was nothing more then a bother. every memory just feels awkward in the back of my head and i just want to shrivel up and die inside. i wish she told me that i was bothering and annoying her instead of ghosting me for weeks but i also feel like i shouldve just taken the hint i guess? it was alot of small things that probably fueled up her resentment for me and the fact that i was just dragging her into situations and topics she had no understandings over. its just UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH i cant even read the last paragraph she sent me without cryingg and i feel so dumbbb

i just want someone to tell me that its even allowed to feel this way over an online friend? ive always had this mindset that it was stupid to feel clingy over people in your phone especially when its people you met on fucking ponytown of all places i guess? they both moves on so quickly while my stupid dumbass poured a little too much into this stupid friendship and i just feel so stupid. im still in contact with that other friend thankfully i guess but its only through tiktok. i just miss our hangouts on ponytown, playing roblox with them, ranting about school with them and everything else. i just miss them so much they were like sisters to me and i feel so dumb for clinging onto online friends like this.</p>

  <p class="message-text">It&#x27;s perfectly okay to feel attachment to people that you&#x27;ve bonded with, even if it&#x27;s over the internet, and even if you met them on ponytown. They are/were your friends, you spent time with them and grew close to them, of course you&#x27;re going to be upset when that connection and bond is lost; it&#x27;s perfectly fine and natural to feel that way.

I understand how it can feel when you&#x27;re looking back at old situations and thinking about all the things you could have done differently, but speaking from experience, if there&#x27;s nothing you can do now, it&#x27;s really not worth worrying about what you should have done then. It will only eat away at you and make you feel worse.

You&#x27;re doing well to acknowledge your mistakes; learn from them for the future.</p>

Regardless of what&#x27;s happening around you or why, letting your natural emotions take their course is always a good thing; even if those emotions feel wrong. So long as you&#x27;re not hurting anyone else, you shouldn&#x27;t have to change your emotional responses.</p>

  <p class="message-text">HELLO HELLO! Thank you for leaving such a nice comment on my guestbook. :3
I was gonna leave one on yours first, but you beat to me to it. I&#x27;ll still leave one anyways since I got more to say!!

Your art is sooo cute I really love it. You&#x27;re so good at drawing characters interacting w/ each other. There Are Only Benefits To The Hananene Grind. . .
I LOVE ALL THE LITTLE DOODADS ON YOUR SITE TOO...! I love them, but I am so bad at slide puzzles. I was on that thang for a good long while. And tbh I can&#x27;t wrap my ahead around coding something so interactive so it&#x27;s cool to me...
BUT I really love sites that have a lot of things on it cause I really love seeing what everybody likes to make and talk about... Obv I can&#x27;t comment on everything bc that&#x27;d be kinda overwhelming n this is already kinda a lot, but!!! Your site is epic and I&#x27;m so excited to read any n&#x27; all new additions you add!!

Have a nice day! (frolicking, lalalaa)
(Our birthdays are literally a day apart btw! and if you count the year we are almost a year apart. I&#x27;ve never met anyone like that so I thought it was fun and inchresting... We are web neighbors as well as bday neighbors. )</p>

I&#x27;m sitting in a call right now while they&#x27;re singing, thinking about something they said that made me upset. i hate the fact that i like them. i dont think they even care about me</p>

  <p class="message-text">I definitely had some experience from earlier that helped! I was working on stuff (with a layout, that helped with the basis for some of my current css) for school and then came here to make my own stuff. and I went through a lot of trial and error to get everything working, (and besides! your site is great too)

and thank you for the song rec! I really enjoyed it</p>

  <p class="message-text">okay so my parents broke up around august last year, but got back together after a month of terrorisation. they broke up again in may, but they&#x27;ve recently got back together. my dad claims my mother has changed, but considering the trauma ive been through because of this woman i dont know if i want to accept her back in my life, let alone view her as my mother. i have acknowledged the fact that she wants to change as a person, i appreciate it but i&#x27;m just not sure if i can stay casual with her around any longer. i&#x27;ve heard, and seen a lot about her thats built up all of my trust issues and anxiety, and its all still fresh in my head. do you have anything, any ideas that can help me? anything is appreciated because i have no idea what to do, as my parents seem happy but im not at all. i am happy for them, being back inlove and healthy again, but im just not sure if i can rebuild my trust and friendship with my own mother</p>

  <p class="message-text">As strange as it my seem given she is your mother, setting boundaries can be a big help in situations like these. Letting her and your father know that you are not comfortable, and laying some ground rules regarding what you are and are not comfortable with her doing to and around you, can be a good first step.

I myself am extremely uncomfortable around my mother as well, but for personal reasons cannot take my own advice; so I avoid her as much as possible and fake a smile when I can&#x27;t, but still made it clear that physical contact is one of my lines not to be crossed.

I don&#x27;t know your situation, nor what kind of parents you have and what their issues are, but if you can, try setting boundaries, and if they wont respect that, you can always try avoiding her as much as possible without it being very obvious that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re doing. It may seem rude or even unhealthy to isolate yourself, but until you can get some kind of therapy to deal with whatever&#x27;s happened to you, and move past it, it may be the best option for you. Again, everyone is different, so take what I say with a grain of salt.

Stay safe, and I hope things get better for you and your family soon.</p>

  <p class="message-text">I was a pretty big fan of Sonic the Hedgehog back in the day. I loved Sonic so much, I had all the games and comics. I&#x27;d pray to Sonic every night before I go to bed, thanking for the life I&#x27;ve been given. &quot;Sonic is love&quot;, I would say, &quot;Sonic is life&quot;. My dad hears me and calls me a faggot. I knew he was just jealous for my devotion of Sonic. I called him a cunt. He slaps me and sends me to go to sleep. I&#x27;m crying now and my face hurts. I lay in bed and it&#x27;s really cold. A warmth is moving towards me. I feel something touch me. It&#x27;s Sonic. I&#x27;m so happy. He whispers in my ear, &quot;Aw yeah, this is happening&quot;. He grabs me with his gloved hedgehog hands, and puts me on my hands and knees. I spread my ass-cheeks for Sonic. He penetrates my butthole. It hurts so much, but I do it for the blue blur. I can feel my butt tearing as my eyes start to water. I push against his force. I want to please Sonic. He exclaims &quot;C&#x27;mon step it up&quot; as he fills my butt with his love. My dad walks in. Sonic looks him straight in the eye, and says, &quot;I&#x27;m outta here&quot;. Sonic leaves through my window. Sonic is love. Sonic is life.</p>

Also I just learned that the creature is called a &quot;Hallucigenia&quot; bc of this page and it&#x27;s awesome so ty for that you get +1 bonus points</p>

  <p class="message-text">i vent about this a lot but i dont think im really ever heard by my family. i get a lot of support from people online but at this point i feel like everyone outside of the online community just looks at me and what i go through as a burden, annoyance or a nuisance. just coming here for comfort at this point. even if it is hearing the same thing over and over again it sorta helps to get support in any way i can 

i genuinely hate being so ill all the time. i hate being told that im just a mentally ill teenager and its normal for me to be feeling this way because im afab. my chest constantly feels like its going to explode, im always out of breath, i feel tired faint and dizzy all the time, i hate it. i hate being on so many pills, i hate seeing the 20 or so orange bottles stacked up in my cabinet. i hate how i feel when i take them, i dont feel like myself anymore. i wish i was healthy again. i wanna go back to the time when i could run as long as i wanted as fast as i wanted, i wanna go back to playing sports, i wanna be involved with the outdoors again, but i cant. im scared all the time, i feel like its only a matter of time before im dead. theres something wrong with me but doctors dont wanna put the time and effort into helping just because im a woman. i just miss my old body, i miss not having chronic illnesses. i miss not being sick and im terrified all the time.</p>

  <p class="message-text">I&#x27;m sorry for the late reply.

That kind of trauma does tend to control people&#x27;s lives, and leave everlasting effects on them including thought processes and habits that are extremely hard to break without the proper help.

Something similar happened to me and because of the way I responded it ended in me receiving an extreme amount of backlash and hate online as a child; and I never saw what I was doing as wrong, because I didn&#x27;t have anyone around to tell me that it was wrong.

What happened to you was horrible, but it wasn&#x27;t your fault. You should find a way to get therapy or other counseling to receive treatment and start recovering from what happened to you. But something you can do on your own is try to detach yourself from that abuser. Falling out of love, especially with an abuser is very hard, but it is possible. Associate them with things that you hate, only have negative thoughts for them, give them no positive energy and remind yourself that they do not love you, and would only continue hurting you if given the chance.

If you can, tell your current partner about what happened, and see if they can help you as well. It may seem scary, but if that person truly cares for you they will be willing to try to help you.

Stay safe, wishing you the best of luck.</p>
